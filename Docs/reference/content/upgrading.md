## Breaking Changes

### Backwards compatibility with driver version 2.7.0â€“2.13.x

Starting in 2.11.0, ``BsonSerializer.Serialize`` will throw an
``InvalidOperationException`` when attempting to serialize an array at
the root of a BSON document. Prior versions would allow this invalid operation.
See https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-2877 and
https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3889 for more details.
